<p class="about_me">
My interest in websites has already appeared over a dozen years ago. Recognizing the changes that have taken place since then in the area of ​​the front-end, I decided to develop my professional path in this direction. I completed two courses in the field of web application development at the basic and intermediate level, delving into the secrets of HTML and CSS. Currently, I am training in Java Script. Expanding my knowledge in this area motivated me even more to learn and develop in the area of ​​creating websites.
